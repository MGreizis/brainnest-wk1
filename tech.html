    <h1>The Tech Industry</h1>
    
    <p>Since the Tech industry is constantly changing, I like to keep up with what is happening within the scene in which I want to work in.</p>
    <p>Lately I have been more interested in Web Development news, but I like to keep up with pretty much anything related to programming / software development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As I want to eventually expand outside of just Web Development, I have also been learning multiple different languages in my free time, which are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a></li>
        <img src="img/python.png" alt="python logo" height="200px" width="400px">
        <li><a href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java</a></li>
        <img src="img/java.jpg" alt="java logo" height="200px" width="400px">
        <li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a></li>
        <img src="img/rust.jpg" alt="rust logo" height="200px" width="400px">
    </ul>

    <p>With some languages I've already had some experience in my past, like Java, but Rust is something completely new to me.</p>
    <img src="img/github.png" alt="my github profile">
    <p>As you can see, my GitHub profile is full of repositories in various languages. And a lot of code that I am working on isn't being pushed to GitHub, as it is most likely just experimental.</p>
