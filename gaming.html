    <h1>Video Games</h1>
    
    <p>Oh boy, where do I even start?</p>
    <p>Video games have been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have been playing video games since I was around 6 years old, and I have been hooked ever since.</p>
    <p>The first video game I ever played was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-most-wanted-2005" target="_blank">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</a> because my older brother was playing it at the time and I decided to (very stealthily) try it out when he wasn't at home.</p>

    <p>And ever since those first experiences, video games have always been something I hold near and dear to my heart. <i>No matter how frustrating some of them might be.</i> Hell, some of my most fond memories from my childhood are just peacefully playing a Nintendo Wii on a random weekend.</p>
    <p>The last couple of years my taste in games has been pretty much the same. Games that I have been playing for multiple years now include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> <b>(unfortunately)</b></li>
        <li>Various Battle Royale games like <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank">The Counter-Strike series</a></li>
        <li>And multiple Sports game titles</li>
    </ul>
